How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 
   By comparing two file we can see where the changes have been made and by looking
   at the two we can easily detect bugs. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help me to see where i have committed changes in the long run and help me to make decision accordingly.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


   Manually chosing when to commit will help me to commit whenever i want but it has it cons 
   too we sometimes might end up commiting unnecessarly.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


     There might be case that making change in one file may change some other files so 
     saving multiple file in one commit is good idea in this case.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   
    It helped me easily find out the number of lines that had been inserted and deleted.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  
   With version-control system I can make any changes in the project without any worry becouse i know that 
   I can go back to the previuos version without any difficulty.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   
   I will create a repository using git
